  title: Identity provider interface for DIVOC
  description: Identity provider service can be abstracted with this interface so that DIVOC can integrate seemlessly.

# Under securityDefinitions we declare which security schemes can be used.
# These definitions do not affect to the operations, but can be applied
# using the 'security' key at the global level or the operation level.
# In this sample, we'll see how to apply the security definition globally,
# and override it at the operation level.
#
# Note that for Access Code Flow, you must provide the Token URL.
securityDefinitions: #TODO check security for provider
  accessCode:
    type: oauth2
    # This should be updated to the Token URL of your OAuth provider.
    tokenUrl: http://example.com/oauth/token
    # This should be updated to the Authorization URL of your OAuth provider.
    authorizationUrl: http://example.com/oauth/auth
    flow: accessCode
    scopes:
      write: allows modifying resources
      read: allows reading resources

# Here we apply the security flow called 'accessCode' globally to all the operations in the spec.
# This security scheme is defined above in the 'securityDefinitions' section.
# Global security can be overridden an operation level as seen in the example below
security:
  - accessCode:
      - read
      - write
paths:
  /identity/validate:
    # In this operation we do not apply the security, because it was applied globally above.
    # The security will be applied to this operation for that reason.
