## DIVOC - Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination and Open Certification


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. **Who is building DIVOC software and how is it licensed?** 
    * All software components within DIVOC are built as open source, funded using philanthropic capital, made available free of charge to anyone around the world. It is built using other open source components/libraries.
2. **How can countries benefit from this?** 
    * Any country can freely use DIVOC, manage the platform within their control, and roll it out to their citizens to enable large scale vaccination programs. Since DIVOC software is open source, there are no royalties, charges, or licensing of any nature.
3. **Can countries host it themselves? Who can help?**
    * Yes, countries can host it themselves and keep all control to themselves including data. Countries may engage any consulting and system integrator organization to help install, configure, run, monitor, and manage.
4. **Given new medicines will be approved, how does DIVOC allow the flexibility to on-board newly approved vaccinations?**
    * Yes, DIVOC provides an approved medicine registry which allows authorities to add/remove approved vaccination medicines along with their frequencies.
5. **I want to use DIVOC to manage multiple vaccination programs across various parts of the country. Is that possible?**
    * Yes, DIVOC is designed to manage multiple vaccination programs concurrently. For each program, both facilities and medicines can be managed within DIVOC.
6. **Does DIVOC allow only Govt facilities or does it in any way mandate use of private facilities?**
    * DIVOC software platform is built to provide flexibility to the adopter through the facility registry. Facility registry functionality built into DIVOC allows adopters to choose either only Govt facilities, or only private facilities, or a combination of both. It depends completely on how the adopter wants to roll out the vaccination program.
7. **Does DIVOC allow the adopter to control the rollout of vaccination in particular geographies?**
    * Yes, adopters can "activate" only those facilities in particular geographic areas if they wish to roll out region by region. Activation and deactivation can be done as an ongoing basis allowing on-boarding and off-boarding of facilities and operators.
8. **Does the DIVOC system allow viewing the supply of medicines against vaccination done so far at various levels from facility all the way to the country?**
    * Yes, DIVOC facility registry can capture supply count of medicine per facility and can track vaccinations against it. Analytics module of DIVOC provides analytics related to this at various aggregation levels such as facility, district, state, and country. While DIVOC does not handle the actual supply and inventory management, it can easily be integrated to such systems to keep supply count up to date.
9. **Does DIVOC allow the adopter to control the rollout rate based on medicine supply?**
    * Yes, adopters can specify "per facility, per day" rate within the registry to ensure throttled roll out based on medicine supply. At any time, adopters can change the control parameters to increase/decrease rate of rollout in various geographies.
10. **I have 1000's of facilities. Can I manage facility parameters based at region level instead of one by one?**
    * Yes, DIVOC allows facility and operator control parameters to be updated in bulk for a whole region such as district or state making management easier.
11. **What happens to people who have no mobile or ID of any sort?**
    * Currently DIVOC is designed to work only where some authenticable ID (such as mobile or email or Aadhaar) is available. But, since DIVOC is an open source software, adopters can extend it to also allow scenarios where only a physical ID is available or no ID is available.
12. **In India, is Aadhaar mandatory for availing vaccination using the DIVOC platform?**
    * No, it is mandatory only if the Government is paying for the vaccination. If either the user is paying or someone else is paying (like employer paying for employees), then any form of digital ID such as mobile or email can be used.
13. **How does facilities get paid? Does DIVOC take care of payments?**
    * DIVOC does not deal with payments per se. It only leverages existing payment methods available in a country. DIVOC is designed to handle 2 scenarios - 1) facilities get medicines directly from the Government and thus vaccination if funded by Government or 2) facilities buy approved medicines themselves and expects the user to pay for it at the time of vaccination. In the case of the first scenario, in India, Aadhaar will be mandated to ensure people can get vaccination only once and only valid people can get it. In the second scenario, in India, UPI pre-paid vouchers can be used to "gift" vaccination coupon (employers, NGOs, CSRs, Philanthropies, etc can do this) which in turn can be used by people at a facility or of course people can make direct payment at the time of vaccination.
14. **Does the DIVOC system allow issuance of "digital vaccination certificates" to people?**
    * Yes, it is integrated within the system. Certificates are natively digital, machine readable, digitally signed, verifiable, and also printable with a QR code making it easy for people to keep it electronically or physically.
15. **How do people get their  "digital vaccination certificates"?**
    * Once vaccination is done, certificate with "valid until" (based on type of vaccination) is issued digitally (a digitally signed and QR coded document). If the user has provided mobile/email, then a link to download the certificate is sent to them. If not, the facility can download, print and give it. At any point in time, users can also go to public portal and retrieve the certificate by giving their mobile/email or for those people who have not given mobile/email and used their Aadhaar instead, can either use Aadhaar OTP or go to a Aadhaar enabled touch point to retrieve the certificate. With user consent, it can also be pushed to Digilocker.
16. **Unlike India, we don't have Digilocker and Aadhaar. What can we do for issuance of "digital vaccination certificates" to people?**
    * Yes, it is integrated within the system. Certificates are natively digital, machine readable, digitally signed, verifiable, and also printable with a QR code making it easy for people to keep it electronically or physically.
